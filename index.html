          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>I started learning to code when I was line chef at Starwood Hotels. I wanted to code to develop and create application with my name on it.
          Over time, I have gained a wealth of experience by creating games and application while I was at Humber College Game Programming course.
        Now I want to challenge myself to become Full-Stack Web Developer.</p>

          <h3>CSS Web Development Challenge</h3>
          <p>As the bootcamp final challenge for creating CSS Website. I am challenging myself to modify website as beauty as possible
            and that would be successful by Angela Yu's lecture. Next project I would use javascript to design website more fancy than this.
            Stay tuned for next challenge!</p>
